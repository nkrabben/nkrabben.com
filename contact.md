	If you've stumbled across an <i>nkrabben</i> on the Internet, you've probably stumbled across me.
	<h2>Twitter</h2>
	<p>The fastest way to contact me is through Twitter, <a href="http://twitter.com/nkrabben">@nkrabben</a>. All opinions I share on Twitter are my own and do not reflect those of my employers.</p>
	<h2>Email</h2>
	<p>You can reach me at <a href="mailto:n@nkrabben.com">n@nkrabben.com</a>.</p>
	<h2>CodedCulture</h2>
	<p>If you are an archive, library, or museum and would like me to consult on a data project, you can reach me at <a href="mailto:nick@codedculture.org">nick@codedculture.org</a>. I specialize in survey analysis and system/workflow analysis. You can see examples of past projects at <a href="http://codedculture.org">codedculture.org</a>.</p>
	<h2>Github</h2>
	<p>I use git for version control on all my projects, whether for work, consulting, or personal. As long as they do not contain sensitive data, I host repositories publicly on GitHub as <a href="https://github.com/nkrabben">nkrabben</a>.</p>
