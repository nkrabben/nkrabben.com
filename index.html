		<p>I am a digital collection manager and educator with experience in libraries, archives, and museums. I work as the digital preservation manager at the New York Public Library where I manage nearly 5 petabytes of born-digital and digitized collections. I also teach courses in digital collection management with a focus on tool experimentation and ethics discussions.</p><p>My goal is to help organizations adapt their technology, policy, and culture to manage digital collections through focused intiatives.</p><p>I also studied mathematics and medieval Turkish history in the past. It comes in handy every now and then.</p>
