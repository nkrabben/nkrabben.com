    The best practices for representing 
    analog audio with digital bitstreams are relatively 
    clear. Sample the signal with 24 bits of resolution at 
    96KHz. The standards for storing the data are less clear, 
    especially for media with complex configurations of 
    faces, regions, and streams. Whether accomplished 
    through metadata and/or file format, the strategy 
    chosen to represent the complexity of the original 
    media has long-term preservation implications. Best 
    practice guides rarely document these edge cases and 
    informal discussions with practitioners have revealed 
    a wide range of practices. This paper aims to outline 
    the specific challenges of representing complex audio 
    objects after digitization and approaches that have 
    been implemented but not widely adopted.

    Digital preservation is easier to accomplish when it is
    considered at the beginning of a project. Working with
    vendors to receive fixity information, employ lossless compression,
    and use quality control software prepares a digitization 
    project for long-term collection management success.

    This workshop will focus on the development and implementation
    of workflows for digital curation, focusing specifically on those 
    that incorporate open-source software. The facilitators are part 
    of the Open Source Software Archival Workflow (OSSArcFlow) project, 
    which brings together researchers, developers of three major 
    OSS digital stewardship systems, and digital stewards at twelve 
    partner institutions including government archives, research 
    institutes, and academic and public libraries.

    Based on a series of online workshops presented by the Open 
    Preservation Foundation in 2017, this workshop that will equip 
    participants with the tools required to submit new entries 
    to PRONOM. Participants will learn the theory behind format 
    signatures, how signatures are created, and how they are 
    shared and used. Each of the workshop’s topics is explained 
    through both lecture and demonstration. Participants engage 
    directly in the signature development process through a 
    series of hands-on activities, using a set of sample files 
    provided by the workshop. Participants will examine these files 
    with hex editors, compare their contents to existing 
    specifications, create draft signatures in XML, and test them 
    using format identification tools such as FIDO and Siegfried. 
    Workshop leaders will also share strategies and resources on 
    how to engage the wider community for assistance. The workshop 
    will help participants gain practical skills in appraisal 
    and analysis of digital files. This relevant real-world 
    experience will help to foster a more knowledgeable user base 
    and improve the the PRONOM registry. To close the workshop, 
    participants will have the opportunity to practice their skills 
    using files from their own collections that are not identified 
    in PRONOM tools. Instructors will be available to answer questions 
    as participants explore their files.

    A format is created, becomes widely used, and eventually fades 
    away. File format obsolescence lies at the core of many digital
    preservation narratives, but does the field know what obsolescence 
    looks like. This demonstration explores the issue of obsolescence 
    with tools that can be used to see the rise and fall of formats 
    in an institution’s collection and potentially distinguish a 
    local extirpation from a mass extinction. By demonstrating the 
    information about format endangerment that can be derived and 
    the tools used to derived it, this demonstration aims to 
    encourage a practice of sharing file format profiles of 
    collections that can be used to better understand the lifecycles 
    of file formats and inform better format management practices.

    There are a number of resources such as PBCore and AE-57 
    for defining metadata specifications for a digitization 
    project, but there are very few resources on how to ensure 
    that the metadata you receive meets your specifications. 
    This presentation outlines an approach taken using JSON Schema 
    to validate the metadata produced by in-house and external 
    labs across multiple projects while digitizing a quarter-million 
    audio, video, and film media. After discussing our initial use 
    of spreadsheets, the problems they solved, and the problems 
    they caused, we will introduce our metadata schema and demonstrate
    how we use it for validation. Particularly important, we will 
    discuss how we maintain and update the schema over time, and 
    how its use has strengthened our preservation workflows.

    The New York Public Library has created over 1.5 PB of files from
    digitizing over 50,000 audio and video items for the long-term
    preservation of their content. This paper details the Library’s usage
    of the BagIt File Packaging Format during Quality Assurance and
    Audit Submissions functions as defined by OAIS. It also discusses
    extensions of the bagit-python library in order repair bags that do
    not pass those functions.
    Working with thousands of terabytes stored in hundreds of thousands 
    of bags requires that our approaches to ingest scale appropriately. 
    Common changes to bags such as the accidental creation
    of system files in bags or purposeful edits of metadata files will
    invalidate the entire bag. Noting and responding to these errors is
    critical for improving workflows, but manual response is impossible. 
    Using the bagit-python library, NYPL has created tools to
    selectively clean system files from bag directories and manifests,
    update or add checksums, and create event logs of repairs.

    This poster will present the headline results from the Open 
    Preservation Community Survey 2015, which surveyed over 130 
    institutions around the world to establish the current state of the 
    art in digital preservation practice. The survey focused on 
    technology adoption and real-world infrastructure and 
    architectures, including demographics about the type and size of 
    the responding institution. The responses include: staff roles and 
    allocations; core digital preservation activities; content types
    accepted for long-term management; storage capacity and models; 
    use of the cloud and consortial solutions; use of open source; 
    repository and workflow systems; and tool adoption. The survey 
    did not ask about policies or costs. In addition, comparisons are 
    drawn with the PLANETS survey [1] from 2009 to show changes 
    in requirements and practice over time. The published analysis 
    and raw data will be forthcoming by the end of 2015.

    The adoption of Electronic Thesis & Dissertations (ETD) programs in 
    colleges and universities has moved the ETD copy of record from
    analog to digital. In many cases, it has also offered the 
    opportunity for students to move from text to a format that
    better represented their work. 
    Previously these other representations were shoehorned into text or 
    physical forms, for example, printing a dataset as an appendix, 
    describing a music recital, or taping a CD to the back cover. With
    ETD’s, students can submit the original supplementary materials
    alongside the text, but doing so increases the complexity of the 
    workflow for both the student and the school.

    This workshop provides an overview of lifecycle management 
    as it applies to ETD program planning & implementation.
    It incorporates a series of models, documents, and curation 
    tools with input from attendees to better understand the 
    relationship of curation activities and stakeholders in an 
    overall ETD program. Attendees will gain a clear 
    understanding of the ETD lifecycle and how to use the deliverables 
    produced by the IMLS-funded Lifecycle Management of ETDs project. 
    It will also introduce concepts regarding the management of 
    supplementary files that are being explored as part of the
    follow-up ETDplus project.
