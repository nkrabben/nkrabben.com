    NYPL’s workflow for transferring optical media to long-term
    storage was met with a challenge: an acquisition of a collection 
    containing thousands of recordable CDs and DVDs. Many programs 
    take a disc-by-disc approach to imaging or transferring optical 
    media, but to deal with a collection of this size, NYPL developed 
    a workflow using a Nimbie AutoLoader and a customized version of 
    KBNL’s open-source IROMLAB software to batch discs for transfer. 
    This workflow prioritized quantity, but, at the outset, it was 
    difficult to tell if every transfer was as accurate as it could 
    be. We discuss the process of evaluating the success of the mass 
    transfer workflow, and the improvements we made to identify and 
    troubleshoot errors that could occur during transfer. A background 
    of the institution and other institutions’ approaches to similar 
    projects is given, then an in-depth discussion of the process of 
    gathering and analyzing data. We finish with a discussion of our 
    takeaways from the project.
